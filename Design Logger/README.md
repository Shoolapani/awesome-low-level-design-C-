# Design Logger: A Simple Logging Framework in C++

Design Logger is a C++ program that demonstrates a simple logging framework. It processes log messages based on their severity level, utilizing a `chain of responsibility` pattern where different log processors handle messages of specific severities.

## Overview of Classes

### `LogLevel` Enum
This enumeration class represents different log levels: INFO, DEBUG, and ERROR.

### `LogProcessor` Class
An abstract class that represents the base log processor. It contains a pointer to the next log processor in the chain and a virtual function `log` that is overridden by derived classes.

### `InfoLogProcess`, `DebugLogProcess`, `ErrorLogProcess` 
These are derived classes from `LogProcessor` that handle INFO, DEBUG, and ERROR log levels, respectively. Each class overrides the `log` function to process messages of the specified severity level.

## Program Flow

1. The program creates a chain of log processors where each processor is responsible for handling a specific log level.
2. When a log message is generated, it is passed through the chain of log processors.
3. Each log processor decides whether it can handle the message based on its severity level. If it can handle it, the message is processed; otherwise, it is passed to the next log processor in the chain.
