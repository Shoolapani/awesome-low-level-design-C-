# Design Logger: A Simple Logging Framework in C++

This C++ program demonstrates a simple logging framework that processes log messages based on their severity level. The program utilizes a `chain of responsibility pattern1`, where different log processors handle messages of specific severities.

## Classes Overview

### `LogLevel` Enum

An enumeration class representing different log levels: INFO, DEBUG, and ERROR.

### `LogProcessor` Class

An abstract class representing the base log processor. It contains a pointer to the next log processor in the chain and a virtual function `log` that is overridden by derived classes.

### `InfoLogProcess`, `DebugLogProcess`, `ErrorLogProcess` Classes

Derived classes from `LogProcessor` that handle INFO, DEBUG, and ERROR log levels, respectively. Each class overrides the `log` function to process messages of the specified severity level.

## How It Works

1. The program creates a chain of log processors where each processor is responsible for handling a specific log level.
2. When a log message is generated, it is passed through the chain of log processors.
3. Each log processor decides whether it can handle the message based on its severity level. If it can handle it, the message is processed; otherwise, it is passed to the next log processor in the chain.
